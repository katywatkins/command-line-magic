# Command Line Magic

## Create aliases for commonly used commands
It saves a ton of time. I don't love that you may end up forgetting what the actual command is, but the time it saves is huge, and it's pretty easy to keep a github file with your aliases and add them to a new machine.

## Edit what your CLI displays.
By default your text seems to always be one color, which makes it really hard to reference what you've done - your commands blend in with the output.

## Disclaimer:
This is definitely not an area of expertise for me, let me know if you have feedback or suggestions!
